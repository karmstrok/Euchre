Welcome to the open Euchre NodeJS server!

The below is default readme from the Cloud9 IDE hosting.  This will be updated when the code gets updated for its end purposes.

This is a test for conflict between origin and working.

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
